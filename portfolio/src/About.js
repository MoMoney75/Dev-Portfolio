            Over the last 9 years, I’ve been working as an 
            automotive technician, five of which have been for Porsche of North America.
            During the pandemic, I had a lot of free time on my hands and started exploring different hobbies
            and that was when I discovered and fell in love with programming. Fast forward
            a few years and now I’m a proud graduate of Springboard's Software Engineer Career Track 
            program and am eager to combine my real-world experience with the technical 
            skills I’ve gained over the last few years.
