            Over the last 10 years, I’ve been working as an 
            automotive technician and fell in love with programming during the pandemic. 
            Now, I’m a proud graduate of Springboard's Software Engineer Career Track 
            program and am eager to combine my real-world experience with the technical 
            skills I’ve gained over the last few years.
